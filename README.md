# Othello AI

This repository contains an implementation of an Othello (Reversi) game along with an AI player that uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to make decisions. The AI evaluates board positions using a heuristic function to determine the best possible move.

Written as a project for the course "Artificial Intelligence" at the University of Ume√•.
